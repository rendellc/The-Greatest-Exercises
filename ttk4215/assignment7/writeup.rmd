# Problem 4.13

First we rewrite the system to the bilinear form based on signals u and y. 
\begin{gather}
  y = \rho^*\left(u - m \ddot{y} - \beta \dot{y} \right) \\
  \frac{y}{\Lambda(s)} = \rho^*\left( -m \frac{s^2 y}{\Lambda(s)} - \beta \frac{s y}{\Lambda(s)} + \frac{u}{\Lambda(s)} \right)  \\
  z = \rho^*\left( \theta^{*^T}\phi + z_1 \right)
\end{gather}

So we have a bilinear parametric model with
\begin{gather}
  \theta^* = \begin{bmatrix} m & \beta \end{bmatrix}^T \\
  \rho^* = 1/k \\
  \phi = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{-s^2 y}{\Lambda(s)} & \frac{-s y}{\Lambda(s)} \end{bmatrix}^T \\
  z_1 = \frac{u}{\Lambda(s)} \\
  z = \frac{y}{\Lambda(s)} \\
  \Lambda(s) = (s - \lambda_1)(s - \lambda_2) \\
  \lambda_1, \lambda_2 < 0
\end{gather}

We know that $\rho^* > 0$, but we don't have a non-zero lower bound. Will use gradient algorithm for bilinear parametrizations to estimate. 

\begin{gather}
  \hat{z} = \rho\left( \theta^T\phi + z_1 \right) = \rho \xi \\
  \epsilon =  \frac{z - \hat{z}}{m^2} \\
  m^2 = 1 + n_s^2 = 1 + \alpha (\phi^T\phi + z_1^2) \\
  \xi = \theta^T\phi + z_1 \\
  \dot{\theta} = \Gamma \epsilon \phi \text{sgn} (\rho^*) \\
  \dot{\rho} = \gamma \epsilon \xi
\end{gather}


We first simulate with $m = 20$, $\beta = 0.1$, and $k = 5$, 
which means $\rho^* = 0.2$, $\theta^* = \begin{bmatrix}20 & 0.1 \end{bmatrix}^T$.

As input we use $u(t) = \sin(0.1t) + \sin(5t) + 20$.

The estimates do converge on the actual value, but it does take some time. 
Interestingly both $m$ and $\beta$ go into the negative numbers. From a physical standpoint this
doesn't make sense so we could probably improve the simulation with a projection to remove this. 



I wasn't able to get good convergence in less than 20 seconds, so adding time varying mass might 
not be that meaningful, but here we go.

It looks like $\beta$ and $\rho$ needs more time to converge now with the changing mass. Actually the
estimate for $\beta$ is quite bad since it is negative, but the estimate for $\rho$ is close to the 
actual value. The mass estimate isn't able to track the actual mass closely, but they follow a 
similar curve, and the estimate seems to improve over time. 
Again we have the problem that $m$ and $\beta$ estimates are negative, which we could account for 
by using a projection.
